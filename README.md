# Analysis of Goals + Assists Against Expected Goals + Assists for the 24/25 Premier League Season

## Executive Summary

This project explores the difference between the goals + assists of premier league players in the 25/25 season and their expected goals + assists.

Expected goals (xG) is a statistical measure that quantifies the quality of a scoring chance by calculating the probability of a shot resulting in a goal, based on historical data for similar shots. A higher xG value indicates a better chance and a higher xAG indicates that the player created a chance for their teammate that was a good chance to score.

It's important to compare these as it tells us which players overperformed and which players underperformed.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle's ["Football Players Stats (2024-2025)"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hubertsidorowicz/football-players-stats-2024-2025). 

This dataset features player statistics from the 2024-2025 season across the top five European leagues, sourced from FBref. Automatically updated weekly.

### Loading and Initial Exploration

We began by importing the CSV dataset into Power BI. 

The initial exploration of the dataset was then conducted to gain insights into its structure and contents.
